% The preamble here sets up a lot of new/revised commands and
% environments.  It's annoying, but please do *not* try to strip these
% out into a separate .sty file (which could lead to the loss of some
% information when we convert the file to other formats).  Instead, keep
% them in the preamble of your main LaTeX source file.


% The following parameters seem to provide a reasonable page setup.

\topmargin 0.0cm

%The next command sets up an environment for the abstract to your paper.

% using a list environment such as {enumerate} can simply add another
% item at the end, and it will be numbered automatically.

% In setting up this template for *Science* papers, we've used both
% the \section* command and the \paragraph* command for topical
% divisions.  Which you use will of course depend on the type of paper
% you're writing.  Review Articles tend to have displayed headings, for
% which \section* is more appropriate; Research Articles, when they have
% formal topical divisions at all, tend to signal them with bold text
% that runs into the paragraph, for which \paragraph* is the right
% choice.  Either way, use the asterisk (*) modifier, as shown, to
% suppress numbering.

\section*{Introduction}
\begin{raggedleft}
Photo manipulation tools have been becoming more powerful and accessible to use than ever before. Almost anyone can open up their favorite photo manipulation tool, like Adobe PhotoShop, and change the image to enhance and alter it. As these techniques get more and more advanced, the distinction between what’s real and what’s been crafted is becoming blurrier, which means that the human eye has difficulty interpreting which images are authentic.
\end{raggedleft}

\begin{raggedleft}
In this paper, we examine the detection of a particular type of image forgery known as copy-move forgery. Copy-move forgery is when portions of the image are resampled to another part of the image with the intent to change the photo's meaning and context. An example of such an attack is removing a person from the scenery by resampling nearby trees in the image to replace the person.

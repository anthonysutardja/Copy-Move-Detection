Abstract: ``Copy-move" forgery, in which a portion of the image is resampled to another region, is a common photo manipulation technique used to alter picture content. Previous work in detecting this type of forgery has shown inaccurate results and inefficient processing time. We propose a combination of methods that result in fast copy-move detection performance. Our method finds invariant features within the image and looks for matches using a modified version of nearest neighbors on oriented patches of the images. Potential corresponding matches are filtered by whether they fit into a set of transformations given by RANSAC.

% In setting up this template for *Science* papers, we've used both
% the \section* command and the \paragraph* command for topical
% divisions.  Which you use will of course depend on the type of paper
% you're writing.  Review Articles tend to have displayed headings, for
% which \section* is more appropriate; Research Articles, when they have
% formal topical divisions at all, tend to signal them with bold text
% that runs into the paragraph, for which \paragraph* is the right
% choice.  Either way, use the asterisk (*) modifier, as shown, to
% suppress numbering.

\section*{Introduction}
Photo manipulation tools have been becoming more powerful and accessible to use than ever before. Almost anyone can open up their favorite photo manipulation tool, like Adobe PhotoShop, and change the image to enhance and alter it. As these techniques get more and more advanced, the distinction between what’s real and what’s been crafted is becoming harder to distinguish, which means that the human eye has difficulty interpreting which images are authentic.

In this paper, we examine the detection of a particular type of image forgery known as copy-move forgery. Copy-move forgery is when portions of the image are resampled to another part of the image with the intent to change the photo's meaning and context. An example of such an attack is replacing a portion of the image with more buildings as seen in Figure 1 [3].

There are many existing methods that attempt to detect copy-move forgery. However, some of these methods have large processing times of up to 2600 seconds [1] and other methods do not achieve reliable detections [2].

We explore a combination of methods that yield reliable copy-move detections in a reasonable amount of time.

\section*{Methodology}
Our method draws inspiration from a technique for stitching photos into into a panorama [4]. We follow a large portion of the panorama stitching pipeline in that we detect interest points, create oriented descriptors around the interest points, find potential matches, and estimate the transformation from the source to destination. Instead of applying this method to image stitching, we use this technique for identifying key features that have a strong correlation to other portions of the image. This is analogous to ``stitching" the photo in question to itself.
